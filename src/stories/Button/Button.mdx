        <p className="sb-section-item-paragraph">Buttons are a common interface element used in Design Systems to enable users to interact with digital products and services.</p>
        <p>Buttons are typically used to trigger an action, such as submitting a form, opening a menu, or initiating a search. They can also be used to navigate between pages or sections of a website or app. The use of consistent button styles helps to create a cohesive user experience and reduce cognitive load for users.</p>
        <p>Our Design System has 3 types of buttons, primary, secondary and tertiary.</p>
